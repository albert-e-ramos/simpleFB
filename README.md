# simpleFB

An HTML plus JavaScript implementation of a console-based Facebook clone.

A Zero to Mastery tutorial by Andrei Neagoie was the starting point.

One important thing that I learned, and not mentioned in the tutorial, was the 'async' command.

I needed the script to wait until the page fully loaded or else the user was unable to see the directions.

What can improve: add CSS, make it look pretty, and add a button to launch the script.
